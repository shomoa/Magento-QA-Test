Five test cases
Tips
1. to sign up with random emails try to use unique emails like useriii#@gmail.com to avoid duplication
2. after sighn up create test case to log out then another test cas to login then start your test cases in the logged account
3. Firstly I run each test cas individually all of them works smoothly
4. also I run the full code and it's running good but take some time so if u faced a delay try to increase the Sleep time between each test case.
5. The most logical case is the lase one how to multiply 2 list with each other it's really was intresting
